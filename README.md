## My process
	- I analazed the design to know where to start from
	- Opened my Virtual Studio Code and started on it, this didnt take much time at all
	- Linked my CSS file externally as usual

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
	- I learnt how to import my font from google fonts (sort of correction from the last challenge i attempted)

### Continued development
I want to learn how to use CSS flexbox more. I wasn't able to implement it while working so i scraped it out.
